# solarSimSuite
Solar Cell Simulation Suite that explores the efficiency of repurposing existing city infrastructure to generate electricity using solar panels.
This program simulates four scenarios:

* Installing solar panels on trains
* Installing solar panels on roadways
* Wrapping flexible solar panels around a lightpole
* Upgrading a stationary solar panel farm with panels that rotate

This program takes US zipcodes as standard inputs, with various other inputs that are specific to each scenario.
The input fields are filled in with example numbers and can be changed if needed.

The mathematical models are very accurate; the solar insolation calculation function accounts for time of day, time of year, location on earth, and even accounts for atmospheric interference.
